Details on Meeting
Talked with Jenny - she will take care of beaming the simulcast onto the big screen for us tomorrow morning.  I looked at the conference room, and it looks the way we left it yesterday - dirty.  Talked with the security guys and they called to check on cleaning crew. Should be here this afternoon at 2:00, so the room should be clean and neat by tomorrow morning.  Have sent e-mail notice of meeting - included Tony Mends and Allan Sommer since I don t know Paskin s whereabouts and I do know that Mark Pickering won t be here.  Otherwise, Tony and Allan will be out of the loop.  Anyone else who will roll under Paskin that I should include?  I will also leave voice mail messages on everyone s Enron extension and make calls to home numbers so that everyone will know about the 8:00 am meeting.  Brent is here - will meet with McConnell at 3:00 on EGM (commercial) cost savings effort.  Not sure that McConnell will meet with Greg W.   Brent will update me after the 3:00 meeting. --Sally  -----Original Message-----From: 	Beck, Sally  Sent:	Sunday, November  11, 2001 1:27 PMTo:	Piper, Greg; Pickering, Mark; Apollo, Beth; Busby, Todd; Chun, Inja; Dayao, Anthony; Gros, Thomas D.; Hall, Bob M; Hotte, Steve; Johnson, Jeff; Paskin, John; Pearce, Barry; Perlman, Beth; Price, Brent A.; Richter, Brad; Roper, Kerry; Rub, Jenny; Stocker, Steve; Sweeney, Kevin; Webb, Jay; Sommer, Allan; Mends, AnthonyCc:	Spiller, Tina; Valdez, Christina; Costello, Lisa; Stone, Sandy; Carrizales, Blanca; McDonald, Dawn; Hritz, Alice; Lapsley, Carol; Flores-Cuellar, Brenda; Choate, Heather; Villarreal, Lillian; Browder, Mary Lou; Thistleton, Tara; Godden, Kirsten; Perkins, Kim; Westbrook, Cherylene R.; Villanueva, Chantelle; Cannon, Lydia; Latson, Diane; Estrada, Mercedes E.; James, Giselle; Craig, Braedi; Weatherstone, MarySubject:	8:00 AM Meeting - Monday, November 12Please join Greg Piper and me in Conference Room 4075 on the 4th floor of ECS at 8:00 am on Monday, November 12.

Re: ???
Hey Girl, Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.  I really meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  See you!

RE: UK & Continental Power Doorstep
Dear Sally,After the meeting with Rick & Rick, Beth, David and I discussed how best to perform the 4Q 2001 London Doorsteps and have implemented the following:- Before any doorstep takes place, the doorsteppers must work directly with EAS to determine what has been done in regards to control reviews.  To date, what we have obtained from London are the self assessments prepared by Operations and will receive copies of EAS/AA reports upon their completion (expected end-Nov).  - Each doorstepping team has had a conference call with EAS to ensure the doorstep team fully understands what has been done to date around the trading controls and where possible issues lie. We are using the reports noted above as a background for these discussions.- The doorstep teams are all planning to use AA/EAS s deal test results (the only exception to this is Essen, where we feel that additional sampling should be done).  - With the exception of metals (recycling & London) & EOTT, RAC will take on a consulting only role.- As far as the video conference idea was concerned we felt that if the doorstep team was willing to travel that would be the best way to perform the doorstep.  This is because we feel that there is really no substitute for being in the location to hear side comments, feel what morale is like etc. Lastly, we have talked to EAS about adding some procedures on to the testing AA is performing, however, they feel they can not take on any additional work.  This is primarily because AA got a late start this year and is feeling challenged to complete their work.

Since we were in the midst of the budgeting process, we wanted their view on the continuation of Doorstep Reviews, and they resoundingly agreed that the effort is valuable to Enron and that they wanted to be certain that the effort continues.  In reviewing the plans for 4th quarter, one of our issues was the willingness of key staff members to travel long distances in light of the September 11th terrorists attacks.  We were in agreement on postponing some of the planned 4th quarter reviews until early 2002.  Planned reviews for the Metals business and certain other EEL lines of business were reaffirmed by Buy and Causey for completion in the 4th quarter.   Certainly life on October 26 feels different today at Enron than it did on October 3.  I understand multiple demands on staff members currently and the additional demands of the budgeting process, and in your case, the voluntary redundancy program.  In the next few days I will again review the 4th quarter plans for Doorstep reviews with Buy and Causey, sharing with them your concerns.  I will let you know the outcome of those conversations.  If there is still a strong desire to complete these reviews this year, we will work creatively to leverage work that is being done through the EAS process and minimize both travel and time involved.  -Sally  -----Original Message-----From: 	Dyson, Fernley  Sent:	Friday, October  26, 2001 2:24 AMTo:	New, James; Jordan, MikeCc:	Beck, Sally; Apollo, Beth; Brown, Michael - COO LondonSubject:	RE: UK & Continental Power DoorstepThe EAS work takes priority over Doorstep - we need the AA opinion.I m afraid that Doorstep is way down my list of priorities at this time - I certainly do not want other things to suffer.ThanksFernley -----Original Message-----From: 	New, James  Sent:	25 October 2001 20:38To:	Dyson, Fernley; Evans, Coralie; D arcy, Paul; Jordan, MikeCc:	Yeo, RobertSubject:	FW: UK & Continental Power DoorstepIt s official, we are being door stepped.

Comments on the Report are due on Thursday, March 22nd.  The following is a summary of the Report, along with an outline of possible EPSA comments.  We will discuss the report and EPSA s comments further on our weekly Power Marketers conference call.  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563 and ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA call.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Erin Perrigo at 202-628-8200 or  eperrigo@epsa.org.Report SummaryStressing that the proposal is designed to apply only to approximately five percent of the market that remains in real-time and not to the bilateral and forward markets, the Report immediately notes that "ultimately the real solution to California s problems lies in increased investments in infrastructure."The Report recommends that the California ISO conduct a real-time auction with associated measures to mitigate the impact of physical and economic withholding and significant exercises of market power during periods of scarcity:(1) Coordinating and Controlling Outages -  The ISO should coordinate and approve all planned outages by units that have a Participating Generator Agreement (PGA) with the ISO.  Coordination and outage control procedures should then be coupled with reporting requirements to FERC and dispute review should be expedited.  Similarly, the ISO should closely monitor unplanned outages and report questionable outages to FERC for further investigation.(2) Selling Obligations - All capacity that is available and not scheduled to run under sellers with PGAs should be offered in the real-time market  - this obligation would not be imposed on bilateral markets of the ISO day-ahead markets.  PGA generators would have to submit to FERC a dependable capacity for each unit in addition to other operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs, such as heat rate.  FERC Staff would then use this data, in combination with published fuel costs and emission credit data to determine a price that the ISO would use pre-determined to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency.  Load Serving Entities should also be required to name their curtailment price and to identify which loads will be curtailed.(3) Price Mitigation - When called upon to provide the available and unscheduled capacity as mentioned above, PGA unit prices would be mitigated in hours when there is a reserve deficiency, or Stage 3 emergencies (the Report notes that it is "these hours which are extremely conducive to the exercise of market power by suppliers") and will be obligated to sell capacity in real-time at the marginal cost of the highest-priced PGA until called upon to run.(4) Real-time Price Mitigation for Each Generating Unit - all generating units should have a standing, confidential price based on its marginal costs.  This price will be used by the ISO to establish the real-time market clearing price when mitigation is appropriate.  Staff believes that a single market clearing price auction design is appropriate, thus reversing the recommendation to use an as bid design in the December Order.(5) Market Clearing Price - All real-time energy offers should be paid the applicable market clearing price.(6) Conditions for Invoking Mitigation - Mitigation measures should only be applied to critical operating periods, such as emergencies.As noted in the Report, Staff recognizes that there are potential difficulties in implementing the proposal, and that "there are no easy answers to the current problems in the California market."  Among the purported difficulties, Staff notes implementation problems with bidding obligations on imported power, incentive effects on load scheduling, treatment of purchased power, mitigating prices during emergencies, and setting a price component for scarcity.Suggested EPSA CommentsEPSA has a number of concerns with the proposal, however there are a few things we commend.  Namely:  (1) the Staff s timely turnaround of the report, as directed in the December Order; (2) their admission that the overarching problem cannot be solved by these shorter-term mitigation measures, only by increased investments in infrastructure; and (3) recommendation of the single price auction in the real-time market, noting that it should be used for only approximately five percent of the market.  Also, to stress the importance of regulatory certainty, the Report recommends a date-certain "sunset" for the mitigation approach of no more than one year.Areas of concern include:(1) It is not acceptable to use a cost-based model to explain what happens to prices in a shortage period.  The oil shortages of the 1970s are a good illustration - a nine percent cut in free world oil supplies led to the first quadrupling of oil prices from about $3 to $12 per barrel.  Similarly, prices rose to $42 in 1980 with an eight percent reduction in free world oil supply.(2) Staff s proposal for calculation of the market clearing price does not create a market clearing price in scarcity situations, and does not take into account the customer s value of the commodity.  To the extent seller s costs are used, full costs are not included Staff s recommendation.  As outlined in EPSA s recently filed white paper on market monitoring, full costs should include opportunity costs, scarcity value, capacity value, and risk.(3) The Report fails to link high prices to any anti-competitive behavior, yet still alleges such behavior throughout the Report.(4) EPSA opposes the forced bidding into the real-time market as recommended.  This prescription precludes and preempts competitive business decisions and retards the healthy development of the market.(5) The Report s method for calculating the market clearing price is not illustrative of a true market and may create an artificial market clearing price.  The method proposed in FERC s refund order of March 9th may be preferable to the method proposed in this Report.  Staff s method only includes participating generators and does not include imports, and out-of-market purchases.  EPSA prefers a method that is more inclusive of details and characteristics of a true market.

RE: Wind Company
My apologies - I obviously misunderstood the message from last week.  I sho=uld have called you to discuss before firing off my memo.  We are doing eve=rything possible to accelerate cash and reduce expenses in the short-term, =including financing our Dutch blade facility.  We are working to put in pla=ce a bank line for working capital, although that will take a bit of time t=o arrange.  We are also working to defer vendor payments over the next seve=ral weeks.  Our key focus remains getting IMI/Clear Sky closed.  Our deal t=eam is in Columbus, Ohio meeting with AEP this week and our goal is to get =a PSA signed with AEP by month end, then complete the project and close the= sale and term financing in December!  I met with one of AEP s senior guys =in Abilene last week - but for credit concerns over Enron Wind and Enron, h=e continues to say all the right things about the project purchase. Next st=ep is to sign the PSA.

There has not been a =decision not to provide short-term liquidity for Enron Wind.  If there was =I would have called.  Enron is in the midst of a liquidity crisis.  I need =the support of the entire team as does Enron to help us get through this.  =I need you to see the bigger picture and to think of ways that Wind can hel=p.  I need cost reductions, improved cash flow and SUPPORT.Thank you! -----Original Message-----From: =09Umanoff, Adam =20Sent:=09Friday, November 16, 2001 8:30 PMTo:=09Horton, StanleySubject:=09Wind CompanyWhile I understand that the Wind Co is clearly a "non-core" asset for Enron=,  I am very concerned about the apparent decision in Houston not to provid=e short-term liquidity for our operations (I have heard that the wind co is= on its own for cash  going forward). While I am probably more eager than a=nyone to have the Wind Co regain its financial independence, I can not do i=t overnight and am worried about the potentially devasting impact which a l=ack of short-term capital will have on our business and, quite directly, th=e value of this asset to Enron. As you know, our lenders on IMI/Clear Sky have refused to fund a construct=ion loan (they will not take Enron equity bridge risk) - this construction =loan was the most important piece of our working capital/cash funding for Q=4.  AEP and its lenders on IMI/Clear Sky are also expressing serious concer=n about the Enron warranty guaranty (we will likely have to reserve cash to= secure our warranty obligations, further exacerbating our cash position). = FPL and AEP have in essence put on hold their deals with Enron Wind pendin=g some clarity on how Enron s liquidity difficulties may affect Enron Wind.=  AEP has gone as far as saying the Enron Wind is probably BK without worki=ng capital support from Enron, and are understandably asking why should the=y be comfortable with our performance risk?  Our European vendors, still mi=ndful of Tacke s bankruptcy in 1997, are extremely concerned about our fina=ncial condition.  And a number of our counterparties who owe us money but a=re also owed money by Enron affiliates are seeking to set-off those obligat=ions.  While I will have better numbers over this weekend, without the IMI/=Clear Sky construction loan, I will need between $30-35mm through the end o=f the year (until the AEP sale closes) in order to meet our working capital= needs.  Without that support, I can almost guaranty you I will not be able= to sell IMI/Clear Sky to AEP and am worried about our short-term financial= survival. =20Stan - this clearly has serious implications for the value of Enron Wind an=d our sales effort.  I am meeting again with my finance team (such as it is=) over the weekend and on Monday morning.  I will set up some time with you= on Monday or Tuesday to discuss.  I know there is no desire to support the= Wind Co medium to long-term, but a decision to cut us off now could be fat=al.  =20Adam=20

An Enron collapse would cause weeks= of dislocation in the energy markets that would damage other energy trader=s, and it would cause big losses for the Houston company s creditors.=20Just before noon EST, Enron announced in a press release that it had extend=ed to mid-December a $690 million obligation that was due next week. It als=o said that it had agreed with its bankers to draw down the remaining $450 =million of a previously announced $1 billion secured credit line that has J=.P. Morgan Chase as its lead banker.=20Investors have been fleeing Enron since the company last month disclosed a =$1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party hedging transactions. T=he Securities and Exchange Commission is probing Enron deals with related p=arties. The October disclosure made investors uneasy because it suggested t=he company hadn t been forthcoming about the true state of its finances, an=d it showed that Enron was facing serious liquidity problems.=20Those fears were temporarily quieted earlier this month when Enron agreed t=o be acquired by smaller rival Dynegy. But Enron s disclosure Monday that i=t faces additional earnings and financing troubles renewed the rush to the =exits. In the Wednesday release, Enron CEO Ken Lay said his company was sti=ll committed to the merger: "We continue to believe that this merger is in =the best interests of our shareholders, employees and lenders." Dynegy late=r issued a press release indicating it is "continuing our confirmatory due =diligence" regarding the merger. Neither Enron nor Dynegy returned calls se=eking comment.=20After plunging 23% Tuesday to $6.99, Enron was down a staggering 34% at one= point Wednesday. It moved slightly higher after the midday press release t=o trade at $4.90. Enron shares have lost more than 80% of their value since= the company issued its third-quarter earnings release last month. Dynegy d=ropped $2.44, to $39.26, though it remains substantially above premerger le=vels.=20At the heart of Enron s trouble is the sense that the company isn t letting= on the full extent of its troubles. The selloff in Enron shares began in e=arnest Oct. 16, when the company disclosed in an earnings conference call t=hat it would take a $1.2 billion writedown to unwind some related-party tra=nsactions. Critics of the company said those deals, in which the company di=d business with separate entities involving Enron managers, raised serious =ethical and disclosure issues.=20The Dynegy merger was taken as a vote of confidence for Enron, since as a b=ig trading partner Dynegy would appear to have a solid grasp of Enron s sit=uation. As a result, shares in both companies rallied after the deal s anno=uncement. But Monday s disclosure that Enron faced $690 million in bond pay=ments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges= than it has detailed. According to a Merrill Lynch report cited in The New= York Times Wednesday, Dynegy wasn t aware of the $690 million obligation. =Critics of the deal wondered whether Enron had told Dynegy about all its ob=ligations. <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10003860.html>=20Liquidity fears have also been rekindled by information contained in a fili=ng of quarterly results that show the company consumed as much as $5 billio=n of cash in recent weeks. By the end of 2002, Enron has to find around $9 =billion to pay back various obligations. It had $1.2 billion in cash on han=d as of Nov. 16, according to the filing.=20Tellingly, Dynegy shares haven t plunged along with Enron, suggesting that =investors see a collapse of the merger as catastrophic for Enron but not fo=r Dynegy. At current levels, Enron shares are trading at more than a 50% di=scount to the Dynegy offer.=20J.P. Morgan has taken a leading role in helping Enron. It has lent funds an=d it helped restructure the $690 million obligation. The bank s stock was d=own 78 cents to $38.62. "We will work with Enron and its other primary lend=ers to develop a plan to strengthen Enron s financial position up to and th=rough its merger with Dynegy," said James Lee, a top banker at Morgan, in t=he Enron release.=20From CBS.MarketWatch.com, online at:DYNEGY, ENRON SAY MERGER TO PROCEEDBy Myra P. Saefong1:52 PM ET Nov 21, 2001WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Merger partners Enron and Dynegy restated theircommitment Wednesday to completing a deal, on the heels of embattledEnron s announcement that its lead lender granted it more time to payoff a $690 million note set to come due next week."We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working toaccelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger,"said Chuck Watson, Dynegy s chairman and chief executive,  in astatement.Shares of Enron (ENE) recovered slightly in afternoon  trading butremained under pressure.On heavy volume, the stock -- which had touched $4 earlier in thesession -- was down $1.83 to trade at $5.16, a new 10-year low. Some 84million shares had changed hands.Enron declined 23 percent Tuesday after the company revealed theupcoming debt deadline and restated its earnings.Meanwhile, Dynegy shares lost $1.83 to stand at $39.87.Enron said that the lead bank on the $690 million debt agreed to extendthe maturity date to mid-December, which will give the company time torestructure the facility, and added it expects to further restructureits debt."We ... believe we can identify a mutually beneficial restructuring toenhance our cash position, strengthen our balance sheet, and addressupcoming maturities," said Jeff McMahon, chief financial officer, in astatement.J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. said it and other lenders are committed tohelping Enron improve its financial position.Also, Enron reaffirmed its commitment to a merger with Dynegy and saidit closed on a previously announced $450 million line of credit fromJ.P. Morgan, collateralized by the company s Northern Natural Gas Co.Enron -- which is being acquired by its smaller rival Dynegy (DYN) at afire-sale price -- revealed in a Securities and Exchange Commissionfiling Monday that it had to pay off or refinance $690 million in debtobligations by next Monday or risk triggering nearly $4 billion inadditional payments.If Enron had missed that deadline and didn t post collateral, investorshad the right to demand immediate liquidation of the assets of one ofEnron s limited partnerships, the unusual business entities at thecenter of the company s murky transactions currently underinvestigation.The SEC filing of Monday also contained yet another restatement offinancial results on the heels of a similar filing that disclosed morethan four years of restated earnings figures.<http://cbs.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=3D%7B35D690E0%2D13BE%2D43D9=%2D9644%2D1B1CF4896115%7D>Earlier Wednesday, Goldman Sachs lowered its rating on Enron s stock to"market performer" from its "U.S. recommended list," citing "major"liquidity issues and concerns over whether the company can recover thebusiness it has lost.CIBC World Markets also cut Enron to a "hold" from a "buy."Commerzbank weighed in Wednesday, saying Enron s viability is in doubt."We believe the filing clearly shows that Enron remains in a precariousfinancial position and its status as a going concern is much in doubt,"analysts Andre Meade and Andrew Smith wrote. "It appears that Enron ssituation could worsen in a number of ways."Though Enron s most recent disclosures shed more light on the fiscalsituation, Meade and Smith characterized the information as "piecemeal.""It appears that the full extent of Enron s problems is not currentlyknown," they said in a note, cautioning clients against investing inEnron.

Re: Meeting 8AM Central Monday
Scott, etal --My final concern.  Is anyone at EES concerned with this outcome --  (1) Accept EES  tiering but use 60% of current usage as baseline, (2) all above 60% is DJ Index, and (3) demand below 60% is paid at $500/Mwh (or the ISO price)?  This is an adaption of our proposal.  Would this be painful?  My big fear is that somehow the CPUC uses our filing against us.

Re: EOL GTC s for Weather Derivatives In Australia
John please see attached GTCs for Australian weather. They are essentially the same as the example that was forwarded to B&M when they got the brief to advise on weather derivatives last month. I understand that B & M are having second thoughts on the gambling question and are due to come in with an advice on the point. There is also a question as to whether the Enron party will be Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. or Enron Japan KK. From a tax perspective Susan what would you prefer? On a related issue what Enron company is on the Passwords Applications and ETAs that are being sent out? Although from a legal perspective it does not matter it may increase acceptance if it were Enron Japan KK.

Steve Cooper voicemail - 03/01/2002
On Friday, Steve Cooper left the following voicemail for employees. Since some employees do not have access to voicemail, we are providing the following transcript of that message. You can also access this message and past messages at:  http://home.enron.com/updates/.________________________________________________________________________VOICEMAILFrom:  Steve CooperDate:  Friday, March 1, 2002Hi everybody.  It s Steve Cooper.  It s Friday afternoon, March 1.  I hope everybody has had a great week.  I want to update everybody on a number of things that have gone on this week, so that you all will be fully in the loop.The week started in a rough-and-tumble fashion.  I went to a town meeting Monday night to meet with a number of our ex-colleagues.  Their disappointment, upset and anger is very understandable.  I, along with the entire management team, have committed that we are going to try to do whatever we can to fashion a reasonable resolution to their various issues.In order to make sure that those that are truly in need have something to fall back on, we asked the court later in the week and got the judge to approve an emergency $5 million fund.  We are now going to fish around for an independent administrator to evaluate the needs and disperse those dollars to former employees.  I wanted you to be aware of that.  I really do appreciate and understand everybody s upset.Last Friday, February 22, we presented to the Creditors  Committee a formal proposal on a retention and severance program.  As can be expected, there was some push back from the committee -- there were issues about some of the data, there were requests for additional data and further clarification.The Creditors  Committee formed a subcommittee.  We provided to them more data.  Jeff McMahon and I met with them on Wednesday, February 27, and we met with them again on Thursday, February 28.  We are scheduled to meet with them again on Monday and Tuesday to resolve all the open issues and to get the full support and endorsement of the Creditors  Committee on this program.I have indicated to the subcommittee that getting a plan in place is Jeff s and my highest priority.  It is not right or fair for anyone to be in a state of ongoing uncertainty about their future, their future compensation, and any financial safety net, so we are going to have to move on this at light speed.  I told the creditors  subcommittee and asked that they tell the full committee that we want to be in a position by the week of March 11 to motion this up to the court.  I ll keep you posted on progress.  I am comfortable that the committee wants to put in place the retention and severance program and now we are just working out the bugs.  Hopefully, by the time we have the employee meeting, we can walk through the composition of the program in detail.The powers that be - management in conjunction with the human resources group - are working on merit increases and promotions.  Hopefully all the details of a program will be finalized next week.  Then, the process is typically that business unit managers begin to calculate salary increases.  And it works its way through the review, approval and communication process.  So hopefully, we ll have that all resolved in the next week or two and everyone will know where they stand with respect to promotions and merit increases.We reached an accord with the Astros this week to repatriate to Enron $2.1 million for the release of our rights to the naming contract.  It is a shame we won t be in a position to support the naming of the field, but it is probably in the best interest of the estate.  I got a great suggestion from one of our colleagues about auctioning Enron Field signs and contributing net proceeds to the ex-employees  fund.  I d like your input on that.  I thought it was a great idea and very generous.We are moving forward with plans for an employee meeting later this month.  Hopefully I ll be able to meet many of you there.  I ve tried to get around to say hello here and there.  And again, I would encourage you if you have any questions, concerns or issues just give me an email or a buzz.  Sometimes it takes a few days for me to get back to you, but I m making a very concerted effort to answer everybody s inquiries.Other than that I don t have a lot to report.  We ll continue to hammer out with the committee the retention program.  Hopefully by next Friday I ll be able to report very substantial progress in this area.  I want to thank everybody for their efforts, all their hard work and their focus on moving things forward.One other thing ?We did have a bank meeting on Thursday afternoon.  We have described to the banks what we believe is a very reorganizable entity here.  We ll be sharing more about that at the employee meeting.  I told the bank group, and it was echoed by management, that we believe there is a reorganizable, viable entity in Enron s future.  I ll bring you all fully up to speed on that at the employee meeting.Anyway, as I was saying ? Thanks so much for all your hard work, your efforts, your dedication.  I hope you have a great weekend.  I ll chat with next week.

Part Time Benefits
Mark:FYI.  Could you please confirm what my reduced salary would be assuming I work 30 hours per week?  This memo doesn t say anything about salary.  Thanks.  Also,  in order to put in 30 hours I was thinking that my office hours would be from 8:30 to 4:30 M-Th, although I m sure that there will be plenty of times when it goes beyond that, but at least this is a benchmark.

Re: Fwd: GSP Benefits Required Action List
Ann, I am following up on the status of the research involving Section 6.4 of the SPA; specifically, what are the potential liabilities of Enron selecting persons for termination and providing those names to the Seller?  I would like to have this research asap because our time table is very short.  Do you have any information on that?  Thanks.  Michelle Cash"ANN MURRAY" <AMURRAY@LLGM.COM> on 07/25/2000 05:40:33 PMTo: <michelle.cash@enron.com>, <PETER.del.vecchio@enron.com>cc: "BENJAMIN G. CLARK" <BGCLARK@LLGM.COM> Subject: Fwd: GSP Benefits Required Action ListMr. del Vecchio and Ms. Cash,We are following up regarding the outstanding benefits issues in the GSP purchase.  It is very important that certain benefits matters be addressed and resolved before the Closing Date.Attached is a copy of our Benefits Required Action list, which was sent to Dolores Lenfest, Mark Greenberg, and Mr. del Vecchio on July 21, 2000.  We spoke with Stuart Zisman today, who suggested we make sure that both of you have receive a recent copy of the list.  (Please let us know if you have any problems opening the WordPerfect document.  The page set-up to print should be  landscape .)Among the outstanding issues is the amount of potential withdrawal liability existing in the 2 multiemployer pension plans.   These numbers should be requested from the multiemployer plans as soon as possible.  A concern has been raised as to whether requesting such information from the multiemployer plans will create problems with the union or plan because the union or plan might be given the false impression that GSP anticipates terminating these benefits.  We do not expect any such problems (especially if the plan is told that the sale is anticipated and the buyer wants to make sure of its potential liabilities).  A request for withdrawal liability, although not a daily event, is something that falls within the ordinary administration of a plan.   The plans should either have this amount immediately available, or be able to calculate this amount for you.  If you would like us to assist you with obtaining this information, please let us know.We have included Dolores Lenfest as the responsible person for the majority of the required actions, since she had been our main contact.  If any of these actions have been assigned to another responsible party, please let us know.Thank you.Ann MurrayCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE:This e-mail, including attachments, contains information that is confidential and it may beprotected by the attorney/client or other privileges.

The only thing that I can find is Sitara #575092.  This is the only August 01 deal we have with them.  This volume and price do not match up.  Sylvia does not recall the deal they describe and  has no paper work for it.  ANR Lebanon Ohio does not sound familiar.  The only thing that I can think of is that they send us a confirmation letter/or transcript from the tapes.  If they can prove to us a time and who they talked to we can then pull our tapes.  Let me know how I can further assist you.  Sorry.PL

Re: Dayrate Cap Indicative Proposal to Noble Drilling
My comments below.  I assume you have already explained to Mark Mey how the option works in excruciating detail.	John Peyton	08/29/2000 04:51 PM		 		 To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT		 cc: Keith MacIvor/Corp/Enron@ENRON		 Subject: Dayrate Cap Indicative Proposal to Noble DrillingDear Mark Taylor,Please review the language below; it is a first attempt at making a non binding proposal to Noble Drilling.  Please return your approved language asap.ThanksJohn A. PeytonDear Mark Mey,We appreciate your interest in our new dayrate financial products.  For your consideration, we would like to indicatively propose a transaction in which Enron North America would purchase a Financial Call Option ("Cap") from Noble Drilling Corporation for the Calculation Period  April 1, 2001 through June 30, 2001 for one Rig.  The Strike Price would be $65,000 per (Rig*Day) and the premium which we would pay to Noble Drilling Corporation (within Five Business Days of the Trade Date) would be US Dollars $200,000.The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and low Rig Day Rates for JU-300 -IC as published by Offshore Data Services, Inc., or its successor, in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig Locator, or any successor publication, published during the applicable Calculation Period, on the page entitled "Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and Day Rates".  The Payment Date(s) would be the fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.We have authority to enter into the above this type of transaction and would be able to move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract.  Because the market for dayrates is highly volatile [and because we may have made similar proposals to other counterparties] (is this true?), this indicative proposal is only good until August 31st, 2000.  We look forward to further discussions. This document contains indicative terms only and is not intended to create a binding or enforceable contract nor is it an offer or commitment to enter into any transaction.  All terms are subject to change until agreement as to a specific transaction has been reached.  ENA is not acting as a fiduciary or advisor and you should evaluate and understand the terms, conditions, and risks of all transactions in making your decisions with respect thereto.  The proposal described herein is subject to further review and approval by ENA and Counterparty and, among other matters, further review and approval of the board of directors of each party, and the negotiations, execution and delivery of definitive agreements containing all appropriate provisions, including those related to credit, limitations of damages and others.Sincerely,John A.

Re: Dereg Articles
Here s the draft that Allegretti is sending.----- Forwarded by Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron on 09/27/2000 02:09 PM -----	Mark Palmer	09/26/2000 04:08 PM				 To: Daniel Allegretti/HOU/EES@EES		 cc: James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron		 Subject: Re: Dereg ArticlesI ve taken the editor s pencil to Dan s draft.  Here s the result: Kirk Johnson s September 26th article, Debate on Need for New Power Plants Ignores Conservation, leaves readers with the misperception that competitive electricity markets discourage conservation.  True customer choice proves otherwise. My company supplies electricity to a number of businesses in Maine.  One of these customers is a  paper mill that uses more electricity than thousands of homes.  When New England power prices temporarily spiked last May, we actually paid the mill to shut down ... which they were more than happy to do.  As a result, the customer made money, the grid worked better, and residential customers didn t hear a word about "brownouts." The financial rewards in the open market create much better incentives to conserve than do the bureaucratic, one-size-fits-all programs of the regulatory elite.  It s proving true in Maine, why not give New York and other states the same choice?Dan AllegrettiEnron Corp.If you like it, send it to the Letters to the Editor section at the New York Times.  The protocol is on the editorial page.Thanks for the quick response, Mark

Allegheny / NEPCO
The "bid" is for an EPC Contract with the equipment.  The implied bid for the equipment is -$16.7MM.  The implied margin in the EPC Contract is $32MM plus $11MM of contingency.  If the risk/reward on the EPC contract is reasonable, then this seems like a great deal.  At the same time, we will attach a Turbine LOI to the EPC LOI making it clear to Allegheny that we can offer the turbines on a stand alone basis.   Should we offer at the $10MM discount or are you OK with -$16.7MM?  Ben and I would hit a -$16.7MM bid.    This would probably close this in January, but we ould try to get a turbine down payment in December.Chris Calger503-464-3735

Must be the only pet, and go to a homewithout children.  The ideal situation would be an older,settled couple, or person.  Riley was abused and is aterrified dog.  He needs to have a home with a yard, becauseas of now, he can t go for a walk.  He shuts down if hesees another dog, a person, a car... anything unfamiliar.I m sure the right person could build his confidence back,but for now, he needs a very secure environment.  I need to find Riley a home by this Sunday!  And, he can tbe shipped.  I do have a picture of him.My other rescue is Jessie.  I still haven t found a homefor her.  But, she is not so urgent.  Jessie also needs tobe the only pet, she terrorized the other two dogs she used to live with.  It s possible she was abused, shedoesn t trust anyone, and will growl at you.  She needsto go to a home without children, I can t take a chance with her actually being pushed to the point of biting.She is getting along fine with Jazz and Shasta, but I keepthinking she is going to start feeling comfortable one ofthese days, and our smooth times will be over!  Jessie willneed someone with lot s of patience, and who has time towork with her.  She needs rules, and someone to enforce them.She is a pretty dominant little gal.

BP states they need to have the volumes/contractnumber information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order toplace nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whateverreason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; andBP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between theEnron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable forthese costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreementas we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, thenCrestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can changethe contract numbers internally.2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignmentagreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penaltycosts/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.Please advise what Enron s position is and how we should proceed.------Bruce KohrsPhone: (403)205-7684Fax: (403)266-1947e-mail:bruce_kohrs@keyspancanada.com

Organizational changes
We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes:Enron Global Assets and ServicesIn order to increase senior management focus on our international businesse=s, we are creating a new business unit, Enron Global Assets and Services (E=GAS).  EGAS will be led by Kevin Hannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Jim H=ughes, Chief Operating Officer.  Kevin will report to the Enron Corp. Offic=e of the Chairman.  With the exception of the Wessex Water Company (which w=ill remain in the Enron Transportation Services organization) and Enron Ind=ia (discussed below), EGAS will include all of the assets and activities of= the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS wi=ll include Enron s assets and merchant activities in South America.  In ord=er to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant bu=siness, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities=.  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merc=hant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services =Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Execut=ive Officer of Enron Americas.Enron IndiaEnron s significant interests in India are commanding increased attention f=rom Enron s senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McD=onald will focus exclusively on Enron s business in India, as Chief Executi=ve Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chair=man.Enron Broadband ServicesWith Kevin s departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also mak=ing a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be Pr=esident and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano =and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within =their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Offic=er of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of t=he Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network= Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Offic=e of the Chairman.Enron Principal InvestmentsIn order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities relat=ed to Enron s core businesses, we are combining the existing investment gro=ups in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Grou=p into a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investm=ents will work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and mana=ge equity investments that leverage Enron s unique and proprietary knowledg=e.  These investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-=outs, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new b=usiness unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will r=eport to an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and= Greg Whalley.=20Enron Corporate DevelopmentIn order to improve coordination of Enron s corporate development activitie=s, we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice =President and Chief Financial Officer.
