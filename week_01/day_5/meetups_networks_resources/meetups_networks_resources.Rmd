# Data industry in Scotland
We are so lucky to live in Scotland when it comes to data:

## Investment

It is estimated that the data industry will be a £20 billion opportunity for Scotland’s economy by 2020 (https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/support-for-businesses/develop-products-and-services/data-driven-innovation). There is an ambition for Edinburgh to be the data capital of Europe, and it can be seen in terms of government funding and investment. For example in the 2017 City Region Deal £60 million was given towards a Data Driven Innovation programme (https://ddi.ac.uk/) and in 2018 the Data Lab secured £13.5m of Scottish Government funding (2018) to run for another 5 years (https://www.thedatalab.com/news/the-data-lab-secures-13-5m-scottish-government-funding/).

## Opportunities & network 

All this investment means a lot of potential opportunities and connections. The beauty of Scotland is that it’s big enough that there are lots of opportunities from many different sectors but small enough that connections made can really have an impact. 

There are loads of great tech/data events for a range of languages and interests and are great for getting to meet people in the sector and hear about companies and what kind of work they are doing. Don’t underestimate what a small conversation or connection made at a meetup or event can make - I’ve got both my data jobs through meeting people at meetups (both of which are listed below). 

# Meetups

Below are a list of potential meet ups in Scotland. Most of the meetups below are on the Meetup site/app (https://www.meetup.com/) but there are quite a few data events on Eventbite (https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/) too. Eventbrite tends to be more one-off talks or hackathons rather than regular events.

We've written a bit of information about some different ones which I've been along to so perhaps these might not of interest to you but would give Meetup a search to see if anything that is

**Personal highlights**  

* Someone tracked tweets relating to Edinburgh Fringe via Twitter API in R to analyse the most popular shows over the month of August

# Conferences 
Conferences are also a great way to meet people and learn about different companies and the work they are doing. Many conferences have scholarships/cheaper tickets for people new to data and also underrepresented groups. If you are interested in going but not through a company sponsorship don’t be afraid to email and say you are paying as an individual and new to the industry - worth an ask!
