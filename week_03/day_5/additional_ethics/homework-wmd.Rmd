# Brief

In her thought-provoking book Weapons of Math Destruction Cathy O'Neil argues that societal biases are perpetuated by algorithms.

In this interview she summarises her views on the power of opaque algorithms and gives some real-world examples of where this has happened. She also offers some views on how this might be improved in the future.
