# Dirty Data Project

## Dataset 1 : Decathalon data

Here is my report about my first dataset. Let's start at the beginning... 


### Cleaning notes


The dataset I used was `this_one.csv`. To clean it I did the following :

1. Cleaned this...   
2. Cleaned that... 
3. And finally this... 

Here is my code:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r}
student_sleep_data <- sleep

student_sleep_data %>% 
  summarise(mean(extra))

```


And here is my plot, which I will hide the code for but print the graph: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(student_sleep_data$extra)
```



Here is some code that I want to display, but not run:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
print(student_sleep_data)
```


Now finally, here is a table I've drawn up. 
  
  
Table Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Table Cell   | Cell 2
Cell 3       | Cell 4
