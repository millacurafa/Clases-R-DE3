# Conditional probability

<br>

Often we'd like to be able to compute the probability of one event **given that** we know another has occurred. 

We call this a **conditional probability**, and write $\textrm{prob}(A \mid B)$ for the *"probability of event $A$ occurring given that event $B$ has occurred"*. We could also put this more briefly as the *"probability of $A$ given $B$"*.   

<br>
<div class='emphasis'>
In terms of probability theory, the conditional probability is

$$\textrm{prob}(A \mid B) = \frac{\textrm{prob}(A \cap B)}{\textrm{prob}(B)}$$

In plain language: *the probability of event $A$* **given** *event $B$ , equals the probability of $A$* **AND** *$B$ divided by the probability of $B$ alone*.

Let's return to the roll of a single die to get a clear example, and ask *what is the probability that a 5 was rolled* **given that** *we know an odd number was rolled?"* 
</blockquote> 
<br> 

Applying common sense first, we know that if an odd number was rolled, the event space contains three outcomes: $\{1,3,5\}$. So now $5$ is one outcome amongst three, and we'd calculate that: 

$$\textrm{prob}(5 \mid \textrm{odd}) = \frac{1}{3}$$ 

<br>
<div class='emphasis'>
Note how the **conditioning event** (i.e. number is odd in this case) **narrows** the space of outcomes we have to consider: this is key to understanding conditional probability. 
</div>
<br>

Does the expression above work for this problem? Let's try it out! We define: 

* event $A$: '$\textrm{5 is rolled}$'
* event $B$: '$\textrm{odd is rolled}$' 
* The AND combination (the intersection) gives $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ 5 } \cap \textrm{ odd }) = \frac{1}{6}$
* The probability of $\textrm{odd}$ is $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ odd })=\frac{1}{2}$. 
* Division by $\frac{1}{2}$ is the same as multiplication by $2$, so finally $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ 5 } \mid \textrm{ odd }) = 2 \times \frac{1}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$.

Yep, it works! Time for you to try another problem...

What is the probability that it was a 'Queen' that was drawn from a deck of cards (without Jokers) **given that** we know that a face card was drawn? 

* Try to do this 'intuitively' first by thinking about how the conditioning event 'narrows' the space of outcomes and counting how many 'Queens' there are in this narrowed space.
* Then do it 'mathematically' using the equation above.

[**Hint**: for the mathematical way, you'll need to think about the events `queen_drawn` and `face_card_drawn`, and their intersection].

<details>
<summary>**Solution**</summary>

**The 'intuitive' way**

* The conditioning event is `face_card_drawn`: this narrows the space of outcomes to $12$ cards ($3$ face cards times $4$ suits).
* Four of these cards are 'Queens', so the probability $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ queen_drawn } \mid \textrm{ face_card_drawn }) = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}$

**The 'mathematical' way**

* event $A$: $\textrm{queen_drawn}$
* event $B$: $\textrm{face_card_drawn}$
* The AND combination (the intersection) gives $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ queen_drawn } \cap \textrm{ face_card_drawn }) = \frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}$
* $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ face_card_drawn }) = \frac{12}{52} = \frac{3}{13}$
* So $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ queen_drawn } \mid \textrm{ face_card_drawn }) = \frac{\frac{1}{13}}{\frac{3}{13}}$. Multiply top and bottom by $13$ to get $\frac{1}{3}$.

# Dependent and independent events

Conditional probabilities help us to think about **independent** and **dependent** events. We say that two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if 

$$\textrm{prob}(A \mid B) = \textrm{prob}(A),$$

that is, if the probability of event $A$ is **not affected** by whether event $B$ has happened or not. 

Consider rolling two dice. Is the probability $p(\textrm{second die is 4})$ dependent on the event $p(\textrm{first die is 3})$? Nope, not in any way: the rolls of the dice are completely **independent** of each other, and 

$$\textrm{prob}(\textrm{second die is 4} \mid \textrm{first die is 3}) = \textrm{prob}(\textrm{second die is 4})=\frac{1}{6}$$

This leads to the probability **multiplication laws**:


| Events A and B are...   | Multiplication law              |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
| dependent             | $\textrm{prob}(A \cap B) = \textrm{prob}(A \mid B) \times \textrm{prob}(B)$ |
| independent           | $\textrm{prob}(A \cap B) = \textrm{prob}(A) \times \textrm{prob}(B)$        |


Let's investigate a more interesting problem than the roll of a single die. We'll build a data set on the occurrence of colour blindness in 10,000 individuals categorised by their biological sex (i.e. chromosomal variety)

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# setup the tibble
results <- tibble(
  male = c(420, 5580), 
  female = c(16, 3984)
)

# row and column totals
results <- results %>%
  mutate(row_sums = rowSums(.),
           colour_blind = c("colourblind", "not_colourblind")) %>%
  select(colour_blind, male, female, row_sums)

results
```
<br>

What are the individual probabilities of being:

* colour blind?
* not colour blind?
* male?
* female?

Let's work this out now: 

<br> 

```{r}
# number of people in the results
total <- 10000

# probability of being colour blind
prob_cb <- results %>%
  filter(colour_blind == "colourblind") %>%
  mutate(prob = row_sums / total) %>%
  select(prob)

prob_cb
```

```{r}
# probability of not being colourblind
prob_not_cb <- results %>%
  filter(colour_blind == "not_colourblind") %>%
  mutate(prob = row_sums / total) %>%
  select(prob)

prob_not_cb
```

```{r}
# probability of being male
prob_male <- results %>%
  summarise(male_total = sum(male)) %>%
  mutate(prob = male_total / total) %>%
  select(prob)

prob_male
```

```{r}
# probability of being female
prob_female <- results %>%
  summarise(female_total = sum(female)) %>%
  mutate(prob = female_total / total) %>%
  select(prob)
prob_female
```
<br>

Now we can look at whether being colourblind and gender are truly independent. Let's ask: what is the probability of being female **and** colour blind?

```{r}
prob_female_and_cb <- results %>%
  select(colour_blind, female) %>%
  filter(colour_blind == "colourblind") %>%
  mutate(prob = female / total) %>%
  select(prob)

```

Is this equal to $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{female}) \times \textrm{prob}(\textrm{cb})$?

```{r}
prob_female * prob_cb
```

Nope, it seems not! This means that being colour blind and being female are **dependent events**. In other words: 

<br>
<div class='emphasis'>
The probability of a person being colour blind **depends** upon the biological sex of the person.
</div>
<br>

Let's try the same with male:

```{r}
prob_male_and_cb <- results %>%
  select(colour_blind, male) %>%
  filter(colour_blind == "colourblind") %>%
  mutate(prob = male / total) %>%
  select(prob)

prob_male_and_cb

prob_male * prob_cb
```

Again, this confirms that colour blindness and biological sex are dependent phenomena!

# Final task - Titanic survivors

<blockquote class='task'>
**Task - 20 mins**

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="**Fig. 1.** The RMS Titanic leaving Southport, 10th April 1912 (public domain)", out.width = '60%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/RMS_Titanic.jpg")
```

<br>
A data set detailing the survival or death of passengers and crew members on the RMS Titanic is given below. Some time after the disaster a journalist wrote that crew members were *more likely* to have survived the sinking than passengers. This was disputed by a descendant of one of the surviving crew members, who suggested that the opposite was true, i.e. passengers were *more likely* to have survived than crew.  

You're going to calculate the conditional probabilities $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ survived } \mid \textrm{ crew })$ and $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ survived } \mid \textrm{ passenger })$ to settle this dispute. 

Here's the setup for the tibble (note that exact figures vary slightly in the historical records):

```{r}
titanic_tibble <- tibble(
  passenger = c(488, 812),
  crew = c(215, 703), 
)

titanic_tibble <- titanic_tibble %>%
    mutate(total_deaths = rowSums(.), 
           status = c("survived", "died")) %>%
  select(status, passenger, crew, total_deaths )

titanic_tibble 
```

You will need to:

* Calculate probabilities $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ survived } \cap \textrm{ crew })$ and $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ survived } \cap \textrm{ passenger })$.
* Use these to calculate conditional probabilities $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ survived } \mid \textrm{ crew })$ and $\textrm{prob}(\textrm{ survived } \mid \textrm{ passenger })$.
* Use the conditional probabilities to say whether crew or passengers were more likely to have survived the disaster.

Feel free to do this with pen and paper, if you prefer!

<details>
<summary>**Solution**</summary>


```{r}
# let's see what we have
titanic_tibble  
```

First we need the total : 

```{r}
# how many people in total?
total <- titanic_tibble %>%
summarise(total_value = sum(total_deaths))

total_titanic <- 2218
```
<br>

Then we need the marginal probabilities:   

```{r}
# calculate probability of being crew 
prob_crew <- titanic_tibble %>%
  summarise(total_crew = sum(crew)) %>%
    mutate(prob = total_crew / total_titanic) %>%
  select(prob)

# calculate the probability of being a passenger
prob_passenger <- titanic_tibble %>%
  summarise(total_passenger = sum(passenger)) %>%
    mutate(prob = total_passenger / total_titanic) %>%
  select(prob)

```
<br>

Then we need the joint probabilities:

```{r}
# crew and survived
prob_crew_and_survived <- titanic_tibble %>%
  select(status, crew) %>%
  filter(status == "survived") %>%
  mutate(prob = crew / total_titanic) %>%
  select(prob)

# passenger and survived
prob_passenger_and_survived <- titanic_tibble %>%
  select(status, passenger) %>%
  filter(status == "survived") %>%
  mutate(prob = passenger / total_titanic) %>%
  select(prob)
```
<br>  

Finally, we need the conditional probabilities:    
```{r}  
# survived given you were crew:
prob_survived_given_crew <- prob_crew_and_survived / prob_crew

# survived given you were a passenger:
prob_survived_given_passenger <- prob_passenger_and_survived / prob_passenger 

prob_survived_given_crew
prob_survived_given_passenger
```
So, passengers were $1.6$-times more likely to have survived the sinking than crew members.
