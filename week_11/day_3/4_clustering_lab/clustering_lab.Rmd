# Decision tree
We will be looking at the `avocado` dataset used for the week 10 weekend homework. Build a decision tree to model the likelihood of a sale being of an organic avocado.

# Clustering 
Use k-means clustering to investigate potential relationships in the `USArrests` dataset we looked at in the hierarchical clustering lesson: 

  * Explore the data - do you think it looks potentially suitable for clustering?
  * Chose a value of k
  * Create clusters with chosen value of k - pull out the sizes of the clusters and the average of each variable in the dataset for each cluster.
  * Visualise the clusters (Hint - there is more than 2 variables in the dataset so refer to the classnotes about how to visualise).
