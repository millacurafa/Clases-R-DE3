# Analysis tasks

In the following analysis tasks, we are going to use a data set on incidences of forest fires in the north east of Portugal. You can find a description of the dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires).

## Read data

* Import the `pandas` and `numpy` packages.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

* Now read the file `forestfires.csv` and look at the first few rows.

```{python}
fires = pd.read_csv("forestfires.csv")
fires.head()
```

* Have a look at the methods available on a `pandas` dataframe. 
  - We've already seen `describe()`, so run that on the dataframe you loaded above. 
  - Run another method providing general information on the stored data. 

```{python}
fires.describe(include = "all")
# info() provides general summary information on the stored data
fires.info(verbose = True, null_counts =True)
```

## Missing data

* Which variables having missing data in this data frame?
  - Replace all the missing values in `area` with 0
  - Remove the rows that have missing values in other columns

```{python}
fires.isnull().sum()
# area, temp and wind all have missing data
```

```{python}
fires = fires.fillna({"area": 0})

fires.dropna(inplace = True)
```


## Using the "Verbs"

### Select

* Change your data frame so that columns `X` and `Y` are dropped.

```{python}
#fires = fires[['month', 'day', 'temp', 'wind', 'rain', 'area']]
# or 
fires = fires.drop(columns = ["X", "Y"], axis = 1)
fires.head()
```

### Arrange

* Change your data frame so that it is arranged by `area`, so that the highest `area` fires are first

```{python}
fires = fires.sort_values('area', ascending = False)
```

### Filter

* Change your data frame so that it contains no rows where `area` is zero.

```{python}
fires = fires[fires['area'] != 0]
```

### Mutate

* Create a new column `is_rain`, which is equal to `True` whenever `rain` is greater than zero and `False` otherwise.

```{python}
fires['is_rain'] = fires['rain'] > 0
```

### Group by and summarise

* Find the average `area` of fire:
  - In each `month` of the year
  - In each `day` of the week
  - When there is rain, and when there isn't rain

```{python}
fires.groupby('month')['area'].mean()
```
```{python}
fires.groupby('day')['area'].mean()
```
```{python}
fires.groupby('is_rain')['area'].mean()
```

## Plotting

* Use `matplotlib` to create a histogram of `area`
* Use `seaborn` to create a histogram of `area`
* Use seaborn to create a scatter plot of `temp` vs. `area`

```{python, eval = FALSE}
%matplotlib inline
```
```{python}
import matplotlib as plt
import seaborn as sns

fires["area"].plot(kind="hist")
```
```{python}
sns.distplot(fires['area'])
```

```{python}
sns.regplot(x = 'temp', y = 'area', data = fires)
```
